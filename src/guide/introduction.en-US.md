<!-- ## Name

The term of physics, quark (English: quark), meaning straton, is an elementary particle and the basic unit that constitutes matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, which are the units that make up the nucleus of an atom.

For web developers, UI components are the smallest unit of reusable code for building pages (interactive, reusable, and the smallest unit across technology stacks), which can run in various frameworks or frameless like native tags. in application. So we named it Quark! -->
