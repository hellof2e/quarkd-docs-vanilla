  box3Desc:
    "Unlike other third-party component libraries, quarkd will not update and iterate with the upgrade of the technology stack. It does not need to be updated all year round, and there is no historical burden.",
  whatDesc1:
    "Quarkd is a brand new way of building components. Traditional component frameworks such as Antd and Vant need to do a lot of work in the browser, but Quark puts these tasks into the compilation phase of building applications.",
  whatDesc2:
    "The data modification of the component is handled by the browser's own API, which is simpler and more efficient!",
